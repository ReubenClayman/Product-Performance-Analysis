Explanation:

The product_sales CTE aggregates product sales by month and year, including total revenue, units sold, and transactions.
The seasonal_sales CTE calculates the average sale price and ranks products based on total revenue within each year.
Window Function: PERCENT_RANK() is used to rank products by total revenue within each year.
The query also classifies sales data into seasonal categories (e.g., Holiday, Summer, Off-Peak) based on the month of sale.
